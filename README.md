Hyper Text Media Script. Write Javascript using HTML tags.

## Do I look like a joke to you?

Yes. Don't use this for anything in production. It barely works. It's more of a proof of concept.

## Don't be scared

After you `npm install` the dependencies, run `npx ts-node main.ts demos/display-error.html` to see it generate Javascript.

## This is really happening

It works. There are tests. We did it.
